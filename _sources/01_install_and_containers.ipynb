    "In this notebook, we will not be working with spaCy in code, rather in concept. This entire JupyterBook is designed around approaching spaCy top-down. By this I mean approaching the things that spaCy does and can do and then exploring how to implement that in code. I think this is necessary so that as you explore the smaller components of spaCy, such as the Lemmatizer, you will understand how it fits into the larger architecture of the spaCy framework."

    "A good way to begin is by exploring the question, \"What is spaCy?\" spaCy (yes, spelled with a lowercase \"s\" and uppercase \"C\" is a natural language processing framework. **Natural language processing**, or NLP, is a branch of linguistics that seeks to parse human language in a computer system. This field is generally referred to as computational linguistics, though it has far reaching applications beyond academic linguistic research.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is used in every sector of industry, from academics who leverage it to aid in research to financial analysts who try and predict the stock market. Lawyers use NLP to help analyze thousands of legal documents in seconds to target their research and medical doctors use it to parse patient charts. NLP has been around for decades, but with the increased promise of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, that NLP rapidly expanded. This is because, as we shall learn all too well throughout this book, language is inherently ambiguous. By this, I mean that language does not always make perfect sense. In some cases, it is entirely illogical. The double-negative in English is a good example of this. In some contexts, it can be an emphatic positive, as in, \"I cannot stress this enough, I do not like pasta.\" This is, of course a lie. I love pasta, but you get my point. In other cases, the double negative can be an emphatic negative, as in, \"I ain't not doing that!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans, especially native speakers of a language, we can parse these complex illogical statements with ease, especially with enough context. For computers, this is not always easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because NLP is such a complex problem for computers, it requires a complex solution. The answer has been found in artificial neural networks, or ANNs or neural nets for short. These are the primary areas of research for deep learning practitioners. As the field of deep learning (and machine learning in general) expand and advance, so too does NLP. New methods for training, such as transformer models, push the field further."
