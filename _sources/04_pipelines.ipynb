These solutions are activated by pipes. In this notebook, you will learn about pipes and pipelines generally and the ones offered by spaCy specifically. In a later notebook, we will explore how you can create custom pipes and add them to a spaCy pipeline. Before we jump in, let's import spaCy."

    "SpaCy is much more than an NLP framework. It is also a way of designing and implementing complex pipelines. A **pipeline** is a sequence of **pipes**, or actors on data, that make alterations to the data or extract information from it. In some cases, later pipes require the output from earlier pipes. In other cases, a pipe can exist entirely on its own. An example can be see in the image below."

Two pipes are activated on this, a rules-based named entity recognizer known as an EntityRuler which finds entities and an EntityLinker pipe that identifies what entity that is to perform toponym resolution. The sentence is then outputted with the sentence and the entities annotated. At this point, we could use the doc.ents feature to find the entities in our sentence. In spaCy, you will often use pipelines that are more sophisticated than this. You will specifically use a Tok2Vec input layer to vectorize your input sentence.

    "In most cases, you will use an off-the-shelf spaCy model. In some cases, however, an off-the-shelf model will not fill your needs or will perform a specific task very slowly. A good example of this is sentence tokenization. Imagine if you had a document that was around 1 million sentences long. Even if you used the small English model, your model would take a long time to process those 1 million sentences and separate them. In this instance, you would want to make a blank English model and simply add the Sentencizer to it. The reason is because each pipe in a pipeline will be activated (unless specified) and that means that each pipe from Dependency Parser to named entity recognition will be performed on your data. This is a serious waste of computational resources and time. The small model may take hours to achieve this task. By creating a blank model and simply adding a Sentencizer to it, you can reduce this time to merely minutes.\n",
